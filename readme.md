Needed improvements:

1. need to limit plugin output to 100k characters, which is the openai limit.
2. need to fix the bug that does not allow scraping https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction
3. need to embed links inside the response, not just put them below
4. need to filter links between useful and not useful by the replit.
